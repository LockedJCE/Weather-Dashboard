# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

My motivation for this project was to be able to see the weather and climate in different areas and be able to track that weather data the API is giving me. I built it to have a better display of that than something else i could find. It solves the problem of not knowing the climate of a given day in different locations and I learned implementing APIS is a long and tedious process.

## Usage

To use simply click on the search bar and search for a city and the weather/climate will pop up with temperature, wind speeds, and humidity. You can search multiple cities at once.
